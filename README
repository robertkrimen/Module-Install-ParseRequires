    provides an alternate way to specify dependencies

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        # In Makefile.PL

        use inc::Module::Install;
    
        parse_requires build => <<_END_;
        Test::More 1
        _END_

        parse_requires <<_END_;

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::ParseRequires is a Module::Install extension that lets
    you use a here-document to specify dependencies

USAGE
  parse_requires $document
    Parse $document, treating each line as a space-separated
    distribution/version combination. If no version is specified, then 0 is
    assumed (as usual)

        parse_requires <<_END_
        Moose
        Xyzzy 1.02
        JSON 2
        _END_

    Is equivalent to:

        requires 'Moose' => 0
        requires 'Xyzzy' => 1.02
        requires 'JSON' => 2

  parse_requires $kind, $document
    Parse $document similar to "parse_requires" above. Instead of calling
    "requires" on each dependency, however, the kind of requirement will be
    inferred from $kind, which can be "build", "test", etc.

        parse_requires test => <<_END_
        Test::More
        Test::Xyzzy 1.02
        _END_

    Is equivalent to:

        test_requires 'Test::More' => 0
        test_requires 'Test::Xyzzy' => 1.02

  parse_recommends $document
    Same as "parse_requires" but does a "recommend" instead
